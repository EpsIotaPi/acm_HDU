**==Problem Description==**

There are many lamps in a line. All of them are off at first. A series of operations are carried out on these lamps. On the i-th operation, the lamps whose numbers are the multiple of i change the condition ( on to off and off to on ).

==**Input**==

Each test case contains only a number n ( 0< n<= 10^5^) in a line.

**==Output==**

Output the condition of the n-th lamp after infinity operations ( 0 - off, 1 - on ).

==**Sample Input**==

```
1
5
```

**==Sample Output==**

```
1
0
```



### CODE

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    while (scanf("%d",&n) != EOF) {
        int k = 1;
        int b = 0;
        while (k*k <= n) {
            if (k*k == n) {
                b = 1;
            }
            k++;
        }
        printf("%d\n",b);
    }
    return 0;
