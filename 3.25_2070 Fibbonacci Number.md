# Fibbonacci Number

### 3.25_2070

==**Problem Description**==

Your objective for this question is to develop a program which will generate a fibbonacci number. The fibbonacci function is defined as such:

f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Your program should be able to handle values of n in the range 0 to 50.

**==Input==**

Each test case consists of one integer n in a single line where 0≤n≤50. The input is terminated by -1.

**==Output==**

Print out the answer in a single line for each test case.

==**Sample Input**==

```
3
4
5
-1
```

**==Sample Output==**

```
2
3
5
```

 

### CODE

```CPP
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

long long Fib[52] = {0,1};
int F = 1;

long long Fibbonacci(int num){
    while (F <= num) {
        F++;

        Fib[F] = Fib[F-1] + Fib[F-2];
    }
    return Fib[num];
}

int main() {
    int n = 0;
    while (scanf("%d",&n) != EOF && n != -1) {
        printf("%lld\n",Fibbonacci(n));
    }
    return 0;
}
```
